## The problem this solves

Before this design a type variable cell was a name and an optional
binding. The only constraint machinery was `FnType.constraints`, a list
on the *signature* checked post-hoc at call sites after argument
unification. A node that learned something partial about a type —
arith knowing its operands are numbers — had two tools: bind the cell
now, or leave it unconstrained. Arith bound the cell to the wide
`Number` primitive set, and the wide binding caused three real
problems:

1. **Bare lambdas were monomorphic-wide.** `let f = |a| a + a`
   inferred `fn(a: Number) -> Number` with the wide set baked into the
   cells, so per-site freshening had nothing left to freshen and
   `let x: f64 = f(f64:1.0)` rejected — infectiously, through any op
   touching the result. The explicit `'a: Number` form worked only
   because its return IS the param cell.
2. **Wide sets de-fused regions.** A wide primitive set genuinely
   denotes several register classes, so no freeze could pick one and
   the region silently node-walked; annotating one `let` fixed it —
   exactly the unpredictable performance cliff Graphix exists to avoid.
3. **Bad error locality.** The wide set was legal where it was baked
   and collided with reality downstream, printing a wide-set mismatch
   instead of the violated constraint.

## The design

The cell carries the constraint. `TCell` (`typ/tvar.rs`) holds
`typ: Option<Type>` and `constraints: SmallVec<[Type; 1]>` — a
CONJUNCTION every future binding must satisfy. There is one
enforcement point: the bind sites in the `contains` walk
(`cell_constraints_ok`, `typ/contains.rs`). Binding an unbound cell to
`t` requires every conjunct to contain `t`; violation is a type error
at that site, naming the constraint.

Why a conjunction rather than a single `Option<Type>`: aliasing two
unbound cells must merge their constraints, and alias sites have no
`Env` to intersect types with. Merging conjunctions is infallible; an
unsatisfiable conjunction is detected at SETTLE time by the witness
rule — `TVar::settle` binds an unbound constrained cell to the
narrowest conjunct every other conjunct contains, and "no witness" is
the "unsatisfiable constraints on 'a: i64 & string" error.

### Producers

- The explicit `'a: C |...|` form is sugar: the parser
  (`typexp::fntype`) and `Lambda::compile` alias same-named signature
  leaves onto the declared quantifier's cell first, then
  `add_cell_constraint` — the conjunct lands in the one shared cell.
- `constrain_known` seeds a cell from its def-time binding even for an
  explicitly listed name: `'a: Number |x: 'a| -> 'a f64:0.` gets
  conjuncts `[Number, f64]`, so `f(i64:3)` rejects at the argument. A
  def-time binding is a fact, never erased by instantiation.
- Arith and `Neg` constrain instead of binding: an unbound operand
  cell gets a `Primitive(Typ::number())` conjunct (`node/op.rs`).
  Same-cell operands (`a + a`) alias the result to the operand cell, so
  `|a| a + a` infers `fn(a: 'a) -> 'a, 'a: Number`, identical to the
  explicit form. Distinct-cell operands get a fresh number-constrained
  result cell, and the result-type (`ut`) table re-runs in typecheck1
  after the operand cells settle (`typecheck_tail`), erroring "type
  must be known" only if they are still open then.

Rejected for the distinct-operand case: unifying the operand cells
(a semantic tightening — mixed-type calls that passed would reject),
and keeping the result wide (leaves two-param bare lambdas with the
annotation-reject behaviour). Arithmetic has since been made
homogeneous (`fn('a: Number, 'a) -> 'a`), which resolves the question
from the other side.

### Instantiation

`reset_tvars` freshens keyed by CELL IDENTITY — one fresh cell per
source cell — not by name, so the source's alias topology carries to
every instance (`|a| a + a` shares one cell between `'a` and the
return type in every instance too), and constraints copy to the fresh
cells. Bound cells stay bound: a def-time unification is a settled
fact, and erasing it made the static type lie about the runtime value
(the JIT marshal-panic class).

### Settling

- At `CallSite::typecheck0`-end, constrained cells reachable from the
  return/throws but NOT from any argument (derived results) settle
  eagerly, before an annotation could narrow them — a freely
  narrowable derived cell would be unsound (`let r: f64 = f2(i64:1,
  i64:2)` accepted while the body computes i64). Because the witness
  is the conjunction's narrowest member, a derived cell whose def-time
  fact was `i64` settles to `i64`, not wide. Arg-reachable cells stay
  open through typecheck0: annotations narrow them and the actual
  arguments enforce the narrowing.
- Cells reachable from an OMITTED labeled default are exempt: their
  type belongs to the default expression, and the labeled-default
  check runs after static resolution has installed the per-site
  compiled default nodes, so that unification binds the cell.
- The terminal settle (`FnType::settle_terminal`, typecheck1) walks the
  LIVE ftype in dependency order and settles whatever remains. A cell
  still unbound and unconstrained after the whole tc0 phase binds ⊥
  (`TVar::settle_or_bottom`): nothing ever produced or constrained it.
- ⊥ never binds a cell: the `(TVar-unbound, ⊥)` arm of `contains` is
  no-bind (⊥ is contained by whatever the cell may become, so binding
  gains nothing and forecloses the cell's writers), and `flatten_set`
  drops ⊥ members (an all-⊥ set is ⊥). The eager-bind variant was
  tried first and broke both `f(never(), i64:5)` and the connect-seed
  idiom. `never()` is syntax typed the literal ⊥ at compile time; the
  connect-seed idiom (`let res = never(); res <- v`) lives in the
  binding: an unannotated `let` over a ⊥ initializer seeds a fresh
  cell, writers refine it at their tc0, and `Bind::typecheck1` settles
  a cell nobody refined to ⊥.

### `FnType` derives its constraint list from the cells

The `constraints` list is gone from `FnType` (`typ/fntyp.rs`). Every
former consumer derives from the cells:

- `constraint_view()` — name-sorted `(tvar, constraint)` pairs for
  signature-reachable cells carrying exactly ONE conjunct (a
  multi-conjunct cell prints at use sites as `'a: unbound within A &
  B`; listing an approximation could leak into interface matching).
  Feeds Display, Eq/Ord/Hash, the contains/sig_contains constraint
  checks, and the Pack wire slot (decode re-seeds cells;
  `add_cell_constraint` dedups).
- `FnType.quantifiers: Arc<[ArcStr]>` — the names the `fn<...>` header
  declared, in source order. Names only, excluded from identity; the
  constraint types stay in the cells. This is the one fact the cells
  cannot carry: a self-referential constraint `fn<'a: fn(x: 'a) ->
  _>(…)` is legal, and once seeded the declaring header and the inner
  fn that merely mentions `'a` reach the same cell and conjunct — a
  purely cell-derived view re-prints the header at every occurrence
  forever. `constraint_view` yields pairs only for declared names, so
  the regress terminates with exact print fidelity.
- `replace_auto_constrained` reads inferred `'_N` pairs from the cells
  directly (inference declares no header); `sig_matches_int`'s impl
  side uses `cell_constraint_pairs()` (all reachable single-conjunct
  cells), and its impl-constraint check is SATISFACTION — the
  signature's concrete choice must be admitted by the impl's inferred
  constraint — not structural equality, which spuriously rejected a
  concretely typed `.gxi` signature over an inferred-generic impl.

## Things deliberately left as they are

- **`any_as_tvar` stays.** `Any` pattern leaves serve four consumers
  (unification, exhaustiveness, dead-arm, runtime dispatch) and only
  unification wants tvar behaviour; replacing the leaves with cells at
  construction breaks the other three.
- **Typedef parameter constraints stay separate** (`Option<Type>`,
  checked at ref expansion): a different lifecycle from cell conjuncts
  (checked at bind), and unifying them would mean ref expansion
  instantiating cells with no bug or feature asking for it.
- **`frozen` gates aliasing only** (a frozen var won't re-point); it
  does not block binds and settle ignores it. The ABI freeze already
  refuses multi-class cells, so no "freeze binds iff single register
  class" rule is needed at the typ layer.
- **Dynamically dispatched calls check only the signature**; a
  per-site body inconsistency there de-fuses or lazy-binds instead of
  rejecting.
- **No scoped aliasing.** A polymorphic fn value's instantiated
  signature arriving as payload in another signature brings a second
  quantifier scope into the walks; aliasing its `'a` with the native
  `'a` would build the infinite type, which the merge-occurs guard
  refuses (`alias`/`alias_cells` and the positional `would_cycle`
  guards, marking `cycle_refused`). Scope-aware alias legs were
  diagnosed before implementation (`GRAPHIX_DBG_CYCLE_BT`): the benign
  cross-scope class and genuine infinite types have IDENTICAL refusal
  channel profiles (~50% positional `would_cycle` in argument
  acceptance walks, ~25% CallSite containment, ~15% instance checks,
  ~5% via `alias_tvars`), so scoping the alias legs would remove only
  that last 5% and change no outcome. The only discriminator is the
  marked cell's STATE at terminal settle (open and unconstrained →
  error), which the dependency-ordered settle controls
  deterministically. Nested-fn name flatness within one signature is
  rank-1 polymorphism and load-bearing (`inlang_map`, the def-gate
  param knot, self-referential quantifier constraints); do not
  resurrect per-Fn-boundary scoping or cell provenance without a live
  witness.
