# Per-kernel-instance state (the firing-exactness wire slot)

Status: BUILT (2026-07-03, same day as proposed). Motivated by the two
firing residuals the trace oracle confirmed at fuzzer-v2 phase-2.3
calibration; both are fixed and promoted to `findings/firing-jul2026/`
(the trace-strength regress gate), with `run!` fixtures
(`guarded_select_selection_memory`, `hof_const_body_prev_len`) pinning
the count-observable forms. Two v1 scope notes vs the proposal below:
claims are ROOT-BODY only (`BodyEmitter::allow_state` — a callee is
reached from many call sites whose claims would alias; the per-callsite
sub-buffer composition described below remains future work), and the
select rule was corrected against the observed node-walk: the scrutinee
term STAYS (a scrutinee fire re-emits even with a const arm — verified
2026-07-03); selection memory refines only the GUARD term.

## The problem

A fused kernel is a pure function of its inputs — deliberately. But two
node-walk firing rules are NOT functions of the current cycle's inputs;
they compare against the previous invocation:

1. **HOF resize detection** (`firing_000007`). `MapQ::update` emits iff
   `resized ∨ any slot pred emitted` (plus an unconditional emit when
   the source fires while EMPTY). `resized` compares the source array's
   length against the previous cycle's. The kernel's stateless
   approximation — "source fired ∨ any slot body fired" — over-fires on
   a same-length source event whose slot bodies are all quiet (a map
   with a CONST callback body re-emits per source fire where the
   node-walk emits once). Suppressing the source-fired term without
   length memory would UNDER-fire instead: a shrink with an unchanged
   prefix emits in the node-walk purely because of the resize — wrong
   values, worse than duplicate fires.

2. **Guarded-select selection memory** (`firing_000005`). The node-walk
   emits on a guard-only event only when the SELECTION (which arm is
   taken) actually changes. The kernel's guard-feeder STALE fold fires
   whenever a guard feeder fires — one duplicate emission per
   guard-only cycle with an unchanged selection, and the init
   off-by-one the finding pins (interp 4 / jit 5).

Both need one word of memory that survives across kernel invocations but
belongs to the kernel instance. Each fused region gets fresh memory, just as
each node instance owns its own state.

## The design

**One new leading wire slot.** The kernel ABI's cycle-context prefix
(`kernel_abi::INIT_WIRE_SLOTS`, currently 1: the `event.init` flag)
grows to 2: slot 1 carries `state: *mut u64` — a pointer to a small
zero-initialized buffer owned by the caller, or null when the kernel
claimed no state. Every kernel carries the slot (uniform ABI, same as
the init flag); the pack sites and the wrapper→body forwarding already
have a single source of truth to extend.

**Claiming words.** During emission, a site that needs memory claims
the next index from a counter on the lower ctx and emits loads/stores
at `state + 8*idx`. The final count lands in `KernelSig.state_words`.
Claim sites are ordinary emission code — no new registry, no per-op
vocabulary (this is a CONTEXT slot, not an IR).

**Ownership.** The spliced node (the kernel-callable's invocation site,
where the slots are packed) allocates `Box<[u64]>` zeroed when
`state_words > 0` and passes the pointer on every call. Every runtime Kernel
owns its buffer; the immutable compiled artifact remains shared.

**Zero means "no previous".** Every consumer stores `value + 1` so the
zeroed initial state reads as "no previous observation", and init
semantics fall out without touching the init flag:

- *HOF prev-length word*: stores `len + 1`. `resized := word != len+1`
  (so the first arrival — word 0 — counts as resized, which is also
  what makes "source fires while EMPTY" emit). Exact firing rule:
  `emit := resized ∨ any_slot_fired ∨ (source_fired ∧ len == 0)`.
  The word updates on every kernel run that evaluates the HOF,
  regardless of downstream taint — mirroring `MapQ`'s internal state,
  which advances whether or not anything consumes the result.
- *Select prev-arm word*: stores `arm_index + 1`. On a guard-only fire
  (no scrutinee/arm-input fire), `emit := arm_index+1 != word`. The
  first selection (word 0) always emits.

**What this is NOT.** Not a general mutable-state channel for user
programs (`<-` remains the only cross-cycle mutation, via the lift),
and not a second bottom/taint channel — the state words carry firing
bookkeeping only, invisible to value semantics. A kernel with
`state_words == 0` is bit-for-bit the pure function it is today.

## Ripple points

- `fusion/kernel_abi.rs`: `INIT_WIRE_SLOTS` 1→2 (rename or document
  slot 1); `KernelSig.state_words`.
- `fusion/kernel.rs`: pack site pushes the state pointer; the spliced
  node owns the buffer.
- `fusion/emit.rs`: wrapper→body forwarding of the new slot (the same
  loops that forward the init flag); a `claim_state_word(cx) -> idx`
  helper; the guarded-select consumer.
- `fusion/scaffold.rs` + `stdlib/graphix-package-array`: `SlotFlags::
  apply` grows the exact rule (needs the source len and fired bit —
  both already in hand at the apply site).
- Findings `firing_000005`/`firing_000007` flip to FIXED and promote
  into `graphix-fuzz/findings/` (the trace-strength regress gate).
- `run!` fixtures: const-body map over a reactive source (emit count),
  shrink-with-unchanged-prefix (emit REQUIRED), guard-only unchanged
  selection (quiet), guard-only changed selection (emits).

## Testing

The trace oracle is the referee: both findings' raw shapes (no `count`
instrumentation) must flip from ExtraFire divergence to agreement, the
graphix-tests differential suite must stay green (the shrink under-fire
hazard is a VALUE bug the `run!` fixtures would catch), and a
reactive-generation soak (fuzzer-v2 phase 3) exercises the mechanism
broadly once injection schedules land.
