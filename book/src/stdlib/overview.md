# The Standard Library

The Graphix standard library is split into several modules with different
functions. The `core` module is always imported with an implicit use statement.
The modules are documented in the sig format used by dynamic module signatures.

- `core` fundamental functions and types
- `array` functions for manipulating arrays
- `map` functions for manipulating maps
- `str` functions for manipulating strings
- `re` regular expressions
- `rand` random number generator
- `time` timers and time functions
- `net` netidx functions

The standard library is a work in progress.
