# Late Binding

Functions are always late bound. Late binding means that the runtime actually
figures out which function is going to be called at runtime, not compile time.
At compile time we only know the type of the function we are going to call. This
complicates the compiler significantly, but it is a powerful abstraction tool.
For example we can create two structs of type `T` that each contain a different
implementation of `f`, and we can use them interchangibly with any function that
accepts a `T`. In this simple example we create one implementation of `f` that
increments the count, and one that decrements it.

```
type T = { count: i64, f: fn(T) -> T };
let ts: Array<T> = [
  { count: 0, f: |t: T| {t with count: t.count + 1} },
  { count: 0, f: |t: T| {t with count: t.count - 1} }
];
let t = array::iter(ts);
(t.f)(t)
```

when run this example will output,

```
{count: 1, f: 158}
{count: -1, f: 159}
```

You can clearly see that f is bound to different functions by the runtime since
the lambda ids (158 and 159) are different. While Graphix is not an object
oriented language, you can use closures and late binding to achieve some of the
same outcomes as OOP.
