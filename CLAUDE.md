# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. You should keep this file up to date! Whenever you have a significant conversation with the user about the project you should summarize it in this file as part of completing the assigned task.

## What is Graphix?

Graphix is a dataflow programming language particularly well suited for building UIs and network programming with netidx. Programs are compiled to directed graphs where operations are nodes and edges represent data flow paths. The language is reactive at the language level - when dependent values change, the entire graph updates automatically.

Key language features: lexically scoped, expression-oriented, strongly statically typed with type inference, structural type discipline, parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, pattern matching, first-class functions and closures.

## Project Structure

This is a Rust workspace with these main crates:

- **graphix-compiler**: The compiler that parses and compiles Graphix expressions into node graphs. Entry point is `compile()` in `lib.rs` which calls `compiler::compile()` then typechecks the resulting node.
- **graphix-rt**: A general-purpose runtime that executes the compiled node graphs. The runtime runs in a background task and is interacted with via `GXHandle`. Supports custom extensions via the `GXExt` trait.
- **graphix-package**: Package system for graphix. Handles package loading, vendoring, and standalone builds.
- **graphix-derive**: Proc macros (e.g. `defpackage!`) used by packages.
- **graphix-shell**: REPL and CLI tool. The binary is named `graphix`.

The standard library is split into individual packages under `stdlib/`:
- **graphix-package-core**: Core builtins and types
- **graphix-package-array**, **-map**, **-str**, **-re**, **-rand**: Data structure and utility packages
- **graphix-package-sys**: System-level I/O (unified streams, filesystem, TCP, TLS, netidx, timers)
- **graphix-package-http**: HTTP client/server and REST helpers
- **graphix-package-toml**: TOML serialization/deserialization
- **graphix-package-xls**: Spreadsheet reading (xlsx, xls, ods, xlsb via calamine)
- **graphix-package-pack**: Native binary serialization via netidx Pack format
- **graphix-package-tui**: Terminal UI widgets (ratatui-based)
- **graphix-package-gui**: Graphical UI widgets (iced-based)
- **graphix-tests**: Language feature and stdlib integration tests (separate crate to avoid circular dev-deps)

Each stdlib package has Rust implementations in `src/` and Graphix source in `src/graphix/*.gx`.

Additional directories:
- **book/**: mdbook documentation source
- **book/src/examples/**: All graphix example programs (`tui/`, `gui/`, `net/` subdirs)
- **examples/**: Symlink to `book/src/examples/` for convenience
- **docs/**: Compiled HTML documentation

The compiler depends on netidx (a networked publish-subscribe system) which is expected to be at `../netidx/` (sibling directory).

The project uses workspace-level dependencies where possible.

The project uses poolshark where possible to avoid allocations. If it isn't
possible to avoid allocation using poolshark, then smallvec should be
considered.

```

## Architecture

### Compilation Pipeline

1. **Parsing** (`graphix-compiler/src/expr/parser/`): Text → `Expr` AST with position info
2. **Compilation** (`graphix-compiler/src/node/compiler.rs`): `Expr` → `Node<R, E>` graph
3. **Type Checking**: Each node implements `typecheck()` to verify type correctness

Key types:
- `Expr`: Immutable AST representation with `ExprKind` variants
- `Node<R, E>`: `Box<dyn Update<R, E>>` - compiled graph node
- `ExecCtx<R, E>`: Execution context holding builtins, environment, runtime
- `Scope`: Lexical and dynamic module path information

### Node Graph Execution

Nodes implement either:
- `Update` trait: Regular graph nodes (most built-in nodes)
- `Apply` trait: Function applications (called by `CallSite` nodes)

The `Update` trait requires:
- `update()`: Process events and return output value
- `delete()`: Clean up node and children
- `typecheck()`: Verify types
- `refs()`: Populate referenced bind IDs
- `sleep()`: Put node to sleep (for unselected branches)

### Runtime System

The runtime (`graphix-rt`) implements the `Rt` trait which handles:
- Netidx subscriptions and publications
- Variable references and updates
- RPC calls
- Timer events

Event processing is batch-based: the runtime collects all simultaneous events into an `Event` struct and delivers them to the graph in one cycle. Multiple updates to the same variable in one cycle must be queued for the next cycle.

### Type System

Located in `graphix-compiler/src/typ/`:
- `Type`: Structural types including primitives, tuples, structs, variants, functions, refs
- `TVar`: Type variables for inference (bound via `TVal`)
- `FnType`: Function signature (args, return type, throws, constraints)

Types are structural - compatibility is based on structure, not names. Type inference uses constraint solving with type variables.

### Built-in Functions

Built-ins implement the `BuiltIn<R, E>` trait:
- `NAME`: Function name constant
- `init()`: Returns initialization function

The function's type is declared in the `.gx` file where the builtin is
bound — all arguments and the return type must have type annotations.

Register built-ins with `ExecCtx::register_builtin::<T>()`.

## Coding Style

- Rust code is formatted with `rustfmt` (`rustfmt.toml` in repo). Run `cargo fmt` before submitting.
- Rust conventions: `snake_case` for modules/functions, `CamelCase` for types/traits, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Graphix source files use the `.gx` extension; keep examples small and focused.

## Code Review Process

When doing code review, follow the CR/XCR comment system:

1. Add comments as: `// CR <your-name> for <addressee>: comment text` to the relevant file near the relevant code
2. When issues are addressed, the comment becomes: `// XCR ...`
3. Review XCRs - delete if resolved, convert back to CR with explanation if not

This project maintains very high code quality standards - no shortcuts, careful consideration of all implications.

## Commits and Pull Requests

- Don't commit code unless the user explicitly asks for it
- Commit messages should be short, lowercase, and imperative (e.g., `fix many parser problems`).
- PRs should include a concise summary, testing notes, and links to related issues.
- Treat `docs/` as build output — edit sources in `book/` and regenerate with `mdbook`. If you update docs or examples, rebuild the book.

## Common Patterns

### Working with Types

Use `format_with_flags()` to control type variable formatting:
```rust
format_with_flags(PrintFlag::DerefTVars, || {
    // Type printing code here
})
```

### Error Handling

Use the `wrap!` macro to add expression context to errors:
```rust
wrap!(node, some_result())
```

For creating error values:
```rust
err!(tag, "error message")           // Static message
errf!(tag, "format {}", args)        // Formatted message
```

### Node Implementation

When implementing nodes:
1. Store spec (`Arc<Expr>`) for error reporting
2. Implement all trait methods (update, delete, typecheck, refs, sleep)
3. Use `Refs` to track bound and referenced BindIds
4. Call `ctx.set_var()` when setting variables (handles caching)

## Testing

The purpose of writing tests is not for them to pass, it's to find
bugs in the main code. Never work around a problem with a test that
you think should work. Even if it isn't related to the purpose of the
test you are writing, every failure is an opportunity to learn about a
bug and fix it. If you find such an "off topic" bug, discuss it with
the user before trying to fix it yourself.

The parser includes it's own dedicated tests:
- `graphix-compiler/src/expr/test.rs`: The round trip test of the
  parser pretty printer with random expressions generated by
  proptest. Whenever we change the syntax we must update this test and
  it must run successfully (preferably overnight)
- `graphix-compiler/src/expr/parser/test.rs`: A selection of specific
  tests for the parser.

## Examples

All graphix example programs live in `book/src/examples/` (symlinked as `examples/` from the project root), organized by UI backend:
- `tui/` — Terminal UI examples
- `gui/` — Graphical UI examples (iced-based)
- `net/` — Network examples

The book includes these via mdbook's `{{#include ...}}` syntax, so they serve double duty as documentation and testable code.

TUI and GUI examples are visual and must be tested manually:
```bash
cargo run --bin graphix -- examples/tui/barchart_basic.gx
cargo run --bin graphix -- examples/gui/hello.gx
```

Some examples are code snippets that reference undefined variables and are meant to illustrate concepts within a larger context. These should remain syntactically valid but may not run standalone. When updating the compiler, review these examples to ensure they still compile.

## Development Notes

- The compiler is optimized for dev builds (opt-level="s", lto="thin")
  to reduce compile times. If you need to debug something you can turn
  this optimization off, however the parser may overflow the
  stack without at least some optimization.
- Release builds use full optimization (opt-level=3, codegen-units=1, lto=true)
- Rust edition 2024 is used throughout
- The project uses `triomphe::Arc` instead of `std::sync::Arc` for better performance
- Pooling is used extensively (`poolshark`, `immutable-chunkmap`) to reduce allocations

## Debugging the Compiler

### Trace Facility

The compiler has a built-in trace facility gated by a global `AtomicBool` (`TRACE` in `lib.rs`). Key tools:

- `trace() -> bool`: check if tracing is active
- `set_trace(bool)`: toggle tracing
- `with_trace(enable, spec, f)`: enable tracing for the duration of `f`, prints the spec position and any errors
- `tdbg!(expr)`: like `dbg!()` but only fires when `trace()` is true

Usage in the compiler: `callsite.rs` has `if trace() { ... }` guards that print pre/post callsite FnTypes with deref'd TVars. Builtins like MapQ also print their resolved types via `format_with_flags(PrintFlag::DerefTVars, ...)`.

The trace facility solves a critical problem: the compiler typechecks the entire stdlib on every compilation, which produces gigabytes of debug output if you just add `eprintln!`. To debug a specific expression, use `with_trace` to enable tracing only during that expression's compilation/typecheck, so only the relevant output appears.

### Type Alias Expansion in Contains

When `contains` encounters a `Type::Ref` (e.g. `Result<T, E>`), the Ref case at `contains.rs:56` expands both sides via `lookup_ref(env)` before recursing. This means TVar bindings established during `contains` store the **expanded** form (e.g. `[T, Error<E>]` instead of `Result<T, E>`). Code that inspects resolved types must handle both the `Type::Ref` form and the expanded `Type::Set` form — see `extract_cast_type` in `graphix-package-core/src/lib.rs` for an example.

### Two-Phase Typecheck and Deferred Checks

Builtins that need type information from their call site (e.g. `json::read` for type-directed deserialization) use a two-phase typecheck: return `NeedsCallSite` from `TypecheckPhase::Lambda`, then extract concrete types during `TypecheckPhase::CallSite(resolved)`. The compiler collects deferred check closures during `CallSite::typecheck` and processes them in a `while let Some(check) = ctx.deferred_checks.pop()` loop after primary typechecking. This loop processes cascaded checks automatically — a deferred check that pushes new deferred checks will have those processed in subsequent iterations.

HOF builtins (e.g. `MapQ`, `FoldQ`) that take function-typed arguments must return `NeedsCallSite` and handle the `CallSite(resolved)` phase to update their stored predicate types (`mftyp`, `etyp`) from the resolved FnType. This enables the deferred check cascade to propagate concrete types to inner predicates like `json::read`.

## Recent Changes

### GUI Package (Feb 2026)

Added `graphix-package-gui` — an iced 0.14 based GUI backend. Uses iced sub-crates directly (`iced_core`, `iced_wgpu`, `iced_widget`, etc.) rather than the umbrella `iced` crate for low-level control over the rendering pipeline. Note: `iced_renderer` requires both `wgpu` and `wgpu-bare` features (the cfg checks use the `wgpu-bare` flag which `wgpu` alone doesn't set).

### Package Manager Testing (Mar 2026)

`graphix-package::download_source` may be tested directly by injecting a temporary graphix data dir path and downloading a fixed released `graphix-shell` version from crates.io (for example `0.5.0`). This avoids mutating the user's real `~/.local/share/graphix` tree and provides a regression test for archive extraction layout bugs.

### Data Table Tests & Examples (Apr 2026)

Widget test access pattern: the `GuiWidget` trait gains a `#[cfg(test)] fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any` with a default `unimplemented!()`. Widgets that need test-only state inspection (currently just `DataTableW`) override it to return `self`; a `GuiTestHarness::dt()` helper then downcasts to `&DataTableW<NoExt>`. A `#[cfg(test)] impl DataTableW<X>` block exposes accessors like `dt_ref_width`, `dt_sparkline_len`, `dt_sparkline_values`, `dt_push_sparkline`, `dt_col_callback_id`, `dt_on_resize_callback_id`, and `dt_meta_col_idx`. Tests dispatch per-column callbacks through `gx.call(callable_id, args)` via a `GuiTestHarness::call_callback` helper — the widget itself fires the same callable internally, so this mirrors runtime behavior without pixel layout.

`InternalOnly` in the test ctx DOES spin up a real in-process resolver server, so `sys::net::publish` / `subscribe` round-trips work end-to-end. However, when driving many updates rapidly (e.g. via `seq(0, N)?`), netidx publisher coalescing means the subscriber only sees a few values. For multi-point sparkline subscription tests, space updates with one-shot `sys::time::timer(duration, false)` calls — a repeating timer (`true`) keeps `drain()` looping forever because batches always arrive within its reset window.

ColumnSpec `on_resize` field fix: the .gxi types it as `&[fn(f64) -> Any, null]` (a ref), so the runtime struct value is a u64 BindId, not the callable directly. `parse_column_specs` must extract it as a bid (like `default_value` and `width`) and then `compile_ref` + `compile_callable_opt` to get the actual callable. The widget also tracks the inner ref in `on_resize_refs` so callable swaps at runtime recompile.
